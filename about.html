        <h2>Technical Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am deeply interested in web development, particularly in creating accessible and user-friendly websites.
            I enjoy learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how they can be combined to build responsive and
            visually appealing web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another area of interest is ensuring websites meet accessibility standards. I am passionate about ensuring
            that digital content is usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities, and I enjoy exploring tools
            and techniques to achieve this.
